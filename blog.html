            <h1>Understanding Variables in JavaScript</h1>

            <p>
                In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data.
                There are three ways to declare variables:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>var</code>: Has function scope and is hoisted.</li>
                <li><code>let</code>: Has block scope and is not hoisted.</li>
                <li>
                    <code>const</code>: Has block scope and cannot be reassigned
                    after declaration.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Working with null and undefined</h1>

            <p>
                In JavaScript, <code>null</code> is a special value representing
                the intentional absence of any object value.
                <code>undefined</code> is used to indicate the uninitialized
                state of a variable.
            </p>

            <h1>Understanding REST API</h1>

            <p>
                REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style
                for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use standard
                HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on
                resources. Resources are identified by URLs, and data is usually
                exchanged in JSON format.
